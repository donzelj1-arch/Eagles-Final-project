# Eagles-Final-project
This is my final project for my social statistics course, where I analyzed the past five Philadelphia Eagles seasons and looked to see if there was a pattern between penalties and wins and losses. I looked at every game from the past five seasons to see whether this connection exists and, if so, how strong it is. 
To access and use the script for my project, open the “Donzelli-Final_project.R” file. The dataset can be found in the “table Templates - data (1).csv” file.

The data collected for this project consists of all Philadelphia Eagles regular-season games from the past five NFL seasons. The main goal of this analysis was to examine whether there is a relationship between the number of penalties committed in a game and the team’s win–loss outcome.

For each game, I recorded the total number of penalties committed by the Eagles and the game outcome, coded as 1 for a win and 0 for a loss. Summary statistics for total penalties across all games, as well as penalties broken down by win/loss outcome.

Operationalization

Penalties:
Total penalties were operationalized by recording the number of accepted penalties assessed against the Eagles in each game. These values were taken directly from official NFL box scores.

Outcome:
Game outcome was operationalized as a binary variable:

1 = Win

0 = Loss
This made it possible to compare the average number of penalties between wins and losses.
