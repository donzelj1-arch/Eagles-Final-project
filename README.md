# Eagles-Final-project
This is my final project for my social statistics course where I analyzed the past five Philadelphia Eagles seasons and looked to see if their was a pattern between penalties and wins and losses. i looked at every game from the past five seasons to find if this connection exists and if it does, how strong it is.
